Hello World!

This is my first blog post here on this little blog site I've set up -- I am still ironing out the kinks so I hope you are able to see this.

I am Keivn Ewing, a software engineer and hobby generative artist. I love beaing able to expore my personal creativity through code. This is why, ever since my university class on generative art I have used `p5.js` as an outlet.
