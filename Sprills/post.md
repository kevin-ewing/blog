# Sprill

Hello again its me.

Second blog post in one week. Look at me being so productive. Ive just really been on a generative art kick recently and want to keep it going. As I start this project I have no idea where I want to go with it or even simply what I want to name it. I am going to come up with a random noncense word and write code that 'fits.' How about `Sprill`. Welcome to Sprill reader.
